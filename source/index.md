### What is Espresso?
*Espresso* is a more concentrated form of coffee that originated in Italy. It is produced by forcing hot water under pressure through finely-ground coffee beans. It is thicker and more intense than regular coffee.

### The History of Coffee

Some historians and researchers believe that coffee beans were first eaten in Ethiopia and there is a famous legend that surrounds Kaldi, an Ethiopian goat herder, who is rumored to have first discovered it circa 800 AD. 

### Etymology
The word coffee entered the English vocabulary in 1582 from the Duth word *koffie*, which was borrowed from the Arabic *qahwah* meaning "the dark one". Etymologists have also connected it to the Kaffa region of Ethiopia.

### Where Does Coffee Come From?
Coffee is mostly grown along the "coffee belt" between the Cancer and Capricorn tropics. This includes Central and South America, Central Africa, India, and Southeast Asia.
